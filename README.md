# Plug-in Play ReaPack Repository
I'll upload any JSFX plugins I build for Reaper to this repository:

[https://github.com/Gearoid-O-Broin/plug-inplay/raw/master/index.xml](https://github.com/Gearoid-O-Broin/plug-inplay/raw/master/index.xml).


# Installation
If you have the ReaPack Extension installed, you can add the repository to Reaper with this URL:

```xml
https://github.com/Gearoid-O-Broin/plug-inplay/raw/master/index.xml
```

If you don't have ReaPack installed, you can download plugins individually and place them in your Reaper/Effects directory.

You can also use [ysfx](https://github.com/jpcima/ysfx) or [ReaJS](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/) to run JSFX plugin in another DAW.
